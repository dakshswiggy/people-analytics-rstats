In this document we will briefly practice working with different vector types.  Follow the instructions in the comments of each code chunk.

## Creating and examining vectors

```{r}
# EXERCISE 1
# In a recent coding competition, Liz came first, Alex came second 
# and Jiena came third.

# here is a vector with their names
name <- c("Alex", "Jiena", "Liz")

# Check that this vector is a character vector of length 3


# Create a corresponding numeric vector with each person's position.


# Check that your vector is a numeric vector of length three.



```

## Converting vectors to factors and ordered factors 

```{r}
# EXERCISE 2
# Convert the 'name' character vector to a factor vector called 'name_factor'.
# Check that the conversion succeeded.


# Convert your 'name' character vector to an ordered factor vector
# in increasing position order. Check that the conversion succeeded. 


```
